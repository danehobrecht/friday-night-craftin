"Friday Night Craftin'" is a redstone interpretation of "Friday Night Funkin'", a Newgrounds-originating rhythm game. It was made with the mindset to mimic as many of the components from the original game as possible, while using purely vanilla Minecraft mechanics. To play, [you'll need a working edition of Minecraft Java: Edition (1.16.5)](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Change-Game-Version-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition) and the latest version of the world [sideloaded into the game](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360053272471-Sideloading-Worlds-into-Minecraft-Java-Edition).
